# jemdoc+Mathjax

*jemdoc* is a light text-based markup language designed for creating websites. 

*jemdoc+MathJax* adds the MathJax support to jemdoc. You can use the same jemdoc syntax (and therefore no need to make any changes in your jemdoc scripts if you are an original jemdoc user), but the equations will be beautifully rendered by MathJax.
